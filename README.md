## Charybdis Nano
- A split ergonomic keyboard designed by [BastardKB](https://bastardkb.com/)
 featuring a keywell, 5x3 left side, 5x2 right side, and an integrated trackball.
- My personal build is handwired and does not share the same pinout. If you decide to copy my config please use the correct .dsti's from [erentas' config](https://github.com/erenatas/zmk-config-charybdis-mini-wireless).


**Charybdis Nano (Dongle)** 
   - Wireless dongle version of the Charybdis Nano with a nice!nano or nrf52840 USB dongle as a central half to avoid the annoyances of bluetooth. I use a dual boot system and have a kvm/usb switch to my work laptop and this is just much more seamless than BT.
